# Welcome to Wonky

This project demonstrates some generally handy things that might be useful for creating numerics projects in physics, but keeping an eye on importing some best practices etc. from software engineering. 
These best practices can be relevant when modified slightly but may often overlooked in science. Topics include patterns, scaffolding projects, data management and "dev ops for physicists" all demonstrated either in the sample project or the notebooks.
